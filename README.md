# Faster Tests, Less Money: Our Move from Cypress to Playwright

This repository contains the code examples and test implementations for my blog post about migrating from Cypress to Playwright.

## About

This project demonstrates E2E testing for [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/), a demo e-commerce site, and serves as a practical comparison between Cypress and Playwright test frameworks.

## What's Tested

- User authentication and login flows
- Product filtering and sorting
- Shopping cart operations
- Checkout process
- Edge cases and error handling

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run Cypress tests
npm run cypress:run

# Open Cypress UI
npm run cypress:open
```
